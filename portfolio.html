		<h2> CLIENT PROJECTS</h2>
		<p class="wrapper margins">During the last semester of my both courses, I got an opportunity to a live-client project in which we learn the necessary steps in establishing a working relationship with clients. Throughout my client projects, I have gained invaluable experience conducting in-depth market research, creating marketing campaigns, updating and reviewing website content and providing brand management services. Working in teams, students plan, manage and develop a real-time multimedia based product, while developing teamwork practices and ethics.</p>
